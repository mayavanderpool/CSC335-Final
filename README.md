To run the code, run the Main.java file.

This project models a gradebook for a school. It allows teachers and
students to interact with course material like assignments and grades.

This project uses the Model-View-Controller pattern with the
observer design pattern for updating the GUI. The model is composed
of several back-end classes, including Teacher, Student, and Course.
The View displays the GUI and was built using Java Swing. Using observer,
it updates the GUI automatically when the user interacts with it.
The Controller listens for user actions, then updates the model.

The project is well encapsulated and utilizes design patterns and interfaces
such as Iterator and Compatator.
